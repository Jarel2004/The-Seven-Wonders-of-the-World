                <h3>Overview:</h3>
                <p>The Great Wall of China is the longest structure ever built by humans, stretching across northern China’s rugged mountains, deserts, and plains. It was originally constructed to protect Chinese states from invasions and raids by nomadic tribes from the north.</p>
                
                <h3>Historical Background:</h3>
                <p>Construction began during the 7th century BC, with various dynasties adding sections over the centuries. The most famous parts were built by the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 AD) using bricks and stones instead of tamped earth. Over time, the wall became more than just a defense system it served as a symbol of national unity and strength.</p>
                
                <h3>Architecture & Engineering:</h3>
                <p>The Wall includes watchtowers, barracks, beacon towers, and fortresses. It spans more than 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles), winding over mountains, rivers, and deserts. Workers, soldiers, and prisoners built it by hand, often in harsh conditions.</p>
                
                <h3>Cultural Significance:</h3>
