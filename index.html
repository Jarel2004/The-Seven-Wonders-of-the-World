                <h2>The Great Wall of China (China)</h2>
                <img src="src/greatwall.png" alt="The Great Wall of China">
                <h3>Overview:</h3>
                <p>The Great Wall of China is the longest structure ever built by humans, stretching across northern China’s rugged mountains, deserts, and plains. It was originally constructed to protect Chinese states from invasions and raids by nomadic tribes from the north.</p>
                
                <h3>Historical Background:</h3>
                <p>Construction began during the 7th century BC, with various dynasties adding sections over the centuries. The most famous parts were built by the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 AD) using bricks and stones instead of tamped earth. Over time, the wall became more than just a defense system it served as a symbol of national unity and strength.</p>
                
                <h3>Architecture & Engineering:</h3>
                <p>The Wall includes watchtowers, barracks, beacon towers, and fortresses. It spans more than 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles), winding over mountains, rivers, and deserts. Workers, soldiers, and prisoners built it by hand, often in harsh conditions.</p>
                
                <h3>Cultural Significance:</h3>
                <p>It’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of China’s proudest symbols. The phrase “Not a true hero until you climb the Great Wall” (不到长城非好汉) reflects its importance in Chinese culture.</p>
                
                <h3>Interesting Fact:</h3>
                <p>The Wall is often said to be visible from space, but this is a myth it’s visible only under certain conditions with aid.</p>

                <h3>Cultural Significance:</h3>
                <p>Machu Picchu reflects the Incas’ deep connection to nature and their spiritual beliefs. It aligns perfectly with celestial events, such as solstices, highlighting their astronomical expertise.</p>

                    <li>The Taj Mahal was built by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth.</li>
                    <li>Over 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants were used to complete the construction.</li>
                    <li>The white marble changes color depending on the time of day—pink at dawn, white at midday, and golden under moonlight.</li>
                    <li>It took 22 years to complete (1632–1653).</li>
                    <li>The Taj Mahal is perfectly symmetrical, except for Shah Jahan’s own tomb, which was added later and slightly off-center.</li>
